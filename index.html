        <div class="title">Guiding values</div>
        <p>Clarity was central to ensuring that users could immediately understand how to interact with the pattern recognition game. This value informed the minimalist visual layout, where a simple grid structure and consistent color scheme allowed players to focus on the gameplay without distractions. Feedback mechanisms, such as flashing tiles, color changes, and toast notifications, were designed to clearly communicate progress and errors. Each interaction provides immediate visual and auditory confirmation, reducing any ambiguity and reinforcing the user’s understanding of the system’s responses.
       </p>
       <p>Secondly, engagement guided the sensory and emotional aspects of the design. The inclusion of sound feedback and animated flashes for every user action was meant to keep players immersed and emotionally connected to their performance in game whilst the gentle colour palette contributes to a calm, approachable atmosphere, encouraging repeated interaction without overwhelming the player. Together, these values of clarity and engagement work to create a user experience that feels both intuitive and satisfying, maintaining a balance between simplicity and playfulness.
       </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="title">Rationale</div>
        The design of the user interface prioritised clarity, and intuitive interactions to enhance the player engagement and understanding. Feedback mechanisms were carefully implemented through both visual and auditory cues to reinforce correct and incorrect actions. For example, when users select a tile, visual flashes and subtle sound effects provide immediate confirmation of their input, thereby strengthening cognitive associations and supporting pattern recall.
        <p>The information design follows a minimalist approach, ensuring that the visual hierarchy remains clear and the player’s focus is directed toward the sequence grid. By limiting unnecessary visual elements, the interface maintains simplicity and prevents cognitive overload, allowing users to concentrate on the core task of pattern recognition.
        </p>
        <p>The mapping between user actions and system responses were designed to be direct and predictable, so each button press immediately triggers feedback, maintaining a consistent and intuitive interaction loop. This transparency between cause and effect fosters a strong sense of control and understanding within the player.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the system’s learnability was enhanced through repetition and consistency. By maintaining uniform feedback patterns and clear progress indicators, players can quickly grasp the game’s logic without explicit instruction from the UI. This approach supports a natural learning curve, encouraging users to engage through exploration and reinforces the game’s educational intent.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="title">Changes</div>
        Since the prototype, two key improvements were implemented to enhance user interaction and visual balance. Firstly, a new sound effect now plays for every tile the user clicks, providing immediate auditory feedback that reinforces engagement and supports the game’s pattern recognition focus. There is no silence until every sequence now, which helps in making the user feel more comfortable and relaxed. Secondly, the restart button was repositioned to the centre of the interface to improve layout symmetry and accessibility, ensuring that core controls are visually prominent and easy to locate. 
        <br /><br />

        <div class="title">Timeline</div>
        <p>Throughout the production timeline, development was approached in structured stages to ensure steady progress and iterative refinement. The initial phase focused on conceptual development and visual planning to focus on the theme of no text and implementing the maths.random technique. I chose the pattern recognition game, to define a minimalist, text free interface and put more focus on the interactions between user and the interface.
        </p>
        <p>The mid stage concentrated on implementing the core functionality using JavaScript, such as sequence generation, user input validation, and basic visual feedback and making sure the logic for randomised sound sequences worked as planned. 
        </p>
        <p>In the later stages, time was allocated to refining the experience based on user feedback. Visual feedback was improved through the addition of sound effects for each click and flashing the grid to red to indicate the game has ended. There have also been interface layout adjustments such as centering the restart button to maintain visual hierarchy. Furthermore, there were also devoted sessions to testing, debugging, and polishing the user experience, ensuring the system responded consistently and intuitively. 
        </p>
        <br /><br />

         <div class="title">Best aspect</div>
        The design aspect I am most proud of is the seamless integration of visual and auditory feedback to create an engaging and intuitive audiovisual experience. The combination of flashing animations and responsive sound effects effectively reinforces user actions, making the interaction feel both satisfying and informative. This cohesive feedback system not only enhances playability but also supports learnability by helping users quickly understand how their inputs influence the game’s outcome. Overall, the result is a polished and responsive interface so it feels rewarding and immersive to interact with.
        <br /><br />

         <div class="title">Challening aspect</div>
        The design aspect I found most challenging was achieving a balance between visual clarity and responsive functionality in the interaction feedback system. Implementing the timing of animations and sound effects required careful coordination to ensure they complemented each other without causing confusion or delay. Additionally, debugging issues related to input recognition, particularly when users clicked tiles rapidly, proved difficult, as it required fine tuning the game’s logic to maintain a smooth performance. Therefore, ensuring that every interaction felt consistent and intuitive while keeping the interface visually cohesive was a demanding but valuable part of the design process.
